Calculator made in HTML, CSS, and JS. Project for The Odin Project

## Basic Requirements

**HTML**

For HTML, I'm going to use Flexbox to create a grid that contains a `display`, number buttons (0-9), 5 `operator` buttons (+, -, *, /, and =).

**CSS**

**JavaScript** 

* Functions for:

    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division

* A function `operate()` that takes an `operator` and 2 numbers and calls one of the above functions on the numbers

* A function that populates the display after clicking on a number button
